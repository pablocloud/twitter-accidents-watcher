# Twitter Aciddents Watcher

Monitors Twitter's api to geolocate accidents and show them on a map.

You need to set up twitter4j.properties with your own twitter api keys.

For now there is only a working test, needs a little of work.

You will also need a www.mapbox.com key to display the map in index.html, replacing 
{token} with you api token.
